# Zoo Project
___

## Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.5.5
- Maven
- SQLite

## Overview

This project is a console application developed in Java. The objective is to demonstrate practical skills in creating an application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities using an SQLite database.

The chosen resource for management is the **Animal**, representing animals in a zoo. Each animal has a unique ID and a set of properties, including mandatory fields, optional fields, and varied data types (text, number, and date).

The table below illustrates the database schema used in this project:

| Column             | Type          | Constraints     | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `id`               | `INTEGER`     | `PRIMARY KEY`   | The unique identifier for the animal.    |
| `nome`             | `TEXT`        | `NOT NULL`      | The name of the animal (mandatory field). |
| `data_nascimento`  | `TEXT`        | `NOT NULL`      | Date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format (mandatory field). |
| `especie`          | `TEXT`        |                 | The species of the animal (optional field). |
| `peso`             | `REAL`        |                 | The weight of the animal in kg (optional field). |

*(Note: Column names are in Portuguese as per the original project context.)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ruggieroromulo/ZooProject.git
   cd ZooProject
   ```
   
2. Build the project:
   The project uses Maven to manage dependencies and the build process. The SQLite database will be created automatically on the first run.
   ```sh
    mvn clean install
    ```

### Running the Application
To run the console application, use the following command in the project's root directory. This will execute the packaged JAR file generated by Maven.

```sh
  java -jar target/zoo-project-1.0.0.jar
```
*(Note: The JAR filename may vary. Check the name generated in the `target/` directory after the build.)*

## Using the Application

When you start the application, an interactive menu will be displayed in the console, allowing you to perform CRUD operations.

**Menu Options:**
1.  **List all animals:** Displays a list of all animals stored in the database.
2.  **Find animal by ID:** Prompts for an ID and displays the details of the corresponding animal, if found.
3.  **Register new animal:** Starts a form to add a new animal, prompting for each property and validating the inputs.
4.  **Update animal:** Prompts for the ID of an existing animal to update its information.
5.  **Delete animal:** Prompts for the ID of an animal to remove it from the database.
6.  **Exit:** Closes the application.

**Example Interaction:**
```
=== Zoo Management ===
1. List all animals
2. Find animal by ID
3. Register new animal
4. Update animal
5. Delete animal
6. Exit
Choose an option: 3

--- Register New Animal ---
Name (required): Simba
Date of Birth (YYYY-MM-DD, required): 2019-05-15
Species (optional, press Enter to skip): Lion
Weight in kg (optional, press Enter to skip): 190.5

Animal 'Simba' registered successfully! ID: 1
```

## Database

This project uses **SQLite**, a lightweight, embedded database that stores data in a local file (`zoo.db`), created in the project's root directory.

The SQL script for creating the `animal` table is located in `database/schema.sql` and is executed automatically by the application on its first startup if the database does not exist.

**`database/schema.sql`:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS animal (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    nome TEXT NOT NULL,
    data_nascimento TEXT NOT NULL,
    especie TEXT,
    peso REAL
);
```

## Optional Features

This section describes optional features that have been or could be implemented in the project.

### Unit Tests
To ensure code quality and robustness, unit tests can be implemented using JUnit. To run the tests, use the following command:
```sh
  mvn test```

### Containerization (Docker)
To facilitate distribution and execution in different environments, the application can be containerized with Docker.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```sh
    docker build -t zoo-project .
    ```2.  **Run the container in interactive mode:**
    ```sh
    docker run -it --rm --name zoo-app zoo-project
    ```
This will start the container and open the console application's menu directly in your terminal.
